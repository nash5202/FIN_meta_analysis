# Mixture inverse-normal (mixIN) method for meta analysis
Mixture inverse-normal method for meta-analysis of RNA-seq data.

This repository contains an implementation of mixture inverse-normal (mixIN) method for meta-analysis of multiple but related RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies. The current code demonstrates the method for combination of p-values from two different real glioblastoma RNA-seq studies.

## Prerequisites:
* Results from per-study differential analysis for RNA-seq studies. Popular methods such as DESeq and edgeR can be used for this step. These results should at least contain the raw p-values and logFC from the individual differential analaysis.  
* Assessment of the underlying assumption that p-values for all genes obtained from per-study differential analysis are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis. Usually this assumption is not satisfied in case of RNA-seq data but filtering of weakly expressed genes using the method described in Rau et al. (2014)[1] or using the counts per million criteria described in Raithel et al. (2016)[2] circumvents this difficulty to a significant extent.
* R version 3.6.0 or above.
